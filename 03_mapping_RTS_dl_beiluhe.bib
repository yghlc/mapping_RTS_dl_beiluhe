In such regions, the additional absorptive heat of the asphalt pavement has led to serious deterioration of the road. At the same time, climate warming will increase the depth of the active layer and will increase thaw settlement. Response measures can mitigate further destruction of the QTH. Ground temperatures are used to define permafrost zones and the stability of permafrost. The probable change with climate warming is predicted.},
